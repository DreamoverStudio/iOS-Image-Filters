#ImageFilter
————————————————————————————————————————————
##High-level image/photo filtering on iOS 5+

* Overlay photgraphs Photoshop style for custom image effects
* Also sepia, black & white, hue & saturation, brightness, contrast, etc.
* Inspired initially by Eric Silverberg's pre-iOS 5 image filtering class
* Requires my one-file CCMacros project here on GitHub as well as one class from MGImageUtilities
* Includes several retina & non-retina images for my custom effects lossely based on some popular ones in tap tap tap's Camera+ (Camera Plus as some type)
* Utilizes CoreImage, CIImage and was one of if not the first OS repo on Github to share easy to use but professional CoreImage filtering techniques
* Can be used by iOS devs levels beginner and up to create their own Instagram or Snapseed-like custom filters for the iPad, iPhone, iPod Touch
